# Cat-Fight
Fighting Game

A radical 80's style street-fighting game where the warriors are cats. Based on the totally boss arcade games of the past, this has a nostalgic feel. With many different moves you and your opponent take it to the streets to find out who's the baddest cat on the street. So get the neon biker shorts out, put on your mismatched socks, pop the collar and make sure your hair is sky high with an entire can of Aquanet. Now your bad to the bone and ready to pity the fool!

Party On Dude!!
